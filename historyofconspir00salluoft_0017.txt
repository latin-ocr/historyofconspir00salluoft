Situm has generally been considered us the first among the Romans
who meriwd the title of historian. This celebrated writer was born at
Amiternum, in the territory of the Sabines (to the northwest of Rome),
B. Ο. 86. He was edneated at Rome, and in his early youth appears
w'have been ,desirous to devote himself to literni-y pul-suits. But it
was not easy for one residing in the capital to escape the contagious
desire of military or political distinction. At the age os twenty-seven,
he obtained the situation of Quaest0r‚ which entitled him to a seat in
the θεοειδῆ and about six years afterwards he was eleeted tribune of
the people. While in this office, he attached himself to Caesar, whose
fortunas he continued to followzand in particular, bore a share in
the expedition to Africa, where the seattered remains of Pompey’s
party had united. That region being finally subdued, Sallust was
left by Caesar' as Praetor of Numidia. He remained only a year
in his govermhent, but, during that period, he eni-iched himself by

Ι despniling the province. On his return to Rome, he was aecused

by the N umidians whom he plundered, bnt escaped with impunity by
means of the protection of Caesar, and was quietly permitted to bemke
himself to a luxurious retirement with his ill-gotten wealth. He chose

,ῳ for his favorite retreat a villa nt Tibur, which had belonged to Caesm·;
s‘ fond he also built a magnificent palaee in the subm-bs of Rome, sur-
[- o mundod by delightful plenem-e grounds, which were afterwards well
’ζ huwn and celebrated as the gnrdeus of Sallust. In this retirement,
