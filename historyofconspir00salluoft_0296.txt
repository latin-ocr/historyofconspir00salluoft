This is an original work and not a compilation. It presente the
subject in a new light, and at the same time embraces all that is
valuable for its purpose, that could be drawn from the most emi-

. nent sources, The highest encomiums are received from all quar-
ters3 a few are subjoined.

 

Hooker’s Physiology was duly received. We propose to adopt
it as a text-book, and shall order in the course of a fortnight.

We can truly say that we believe this volume is of great valae,
and we hope that the rare merits of the diligent author will be
both appreciated and patronized.

Dr. Hooker writes with perspicuity‚ explains difficult points
with simplieity, and adapts the subject well to school instruction
and general reading. American Journal of Seianae and Arte.

Here is the remedy for a want which is so evid'ently a want,
and that now we have it supplied, it seems an absurdity to have
lived on wanting it. The present work is a popular treatise, at-

author's fertility of illustrative anecdote to come into play. There
is no need of oommending the work to the attention of a oom-
munity where Dr. Hooker is so well known as he is among us.

Nor-mich Com-ion

I am ready to pronounee it unqualifiedly the most admirable
book or work on the human system that has fallen under my

and thorough elucidation of the great science discussed, they can
nowhere be better satisfied than in the perusal of Dr. Hooker‘s
most excellent work. B. F. anxsnnm, Lcnoamillo, Pa.
