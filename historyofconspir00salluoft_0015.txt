Δ Tm. text of this edition of Sallust is that of G. G. Zumpt, Berlin, 1848,

as given 'in “Chambers’ Educational Course'’—with this difference ⁴
only, that the orthography in a few words of antiquated form has been
changed in conformity with the usage of other Latin writers. The few
forms of ancient orthography still remaining, differ so little from the
ordinary forins, that. no change has been thought necessary; and they
serve in some degree to preserve that. air of antiquity which the. author
simod at 111 his writings.

Though many editions of Sallust have been published, the text can
hardly be regarded even yet as fully settled. The number of manu-
scripts is great, and their discrepancies in many places considerable.
Momver, great libertics have been taken by some editors in making
alterations, often on slight grounds, and sometimes on mere conjecture,

, rendering it diffieult- to know in some places ‚what Sallust really did

write. The latest critical editors of Sallust are Gerlach (Bassel, re-
vised edition, 1832), and Kritz (Leipzig, 1828). Both these declaro
against the arbitrary proceedings of Corte, and yet they differ very

· often in their texts from each other. “ Between thoee two,'’ says Zumpt,

“stands the edition of the learned J. G. Orelli (Zurich, 1840), whose text
forms the basis of this [Zumpt’s] edition. But besides abandoning his

antiquated orthography, and restoring that which is adopted in most

 

’ὲ editions of the latin Classius, we have felt obliged in many mammes

to give up Orelli's reading, and to follow the authority of the best
manuscripts, especially the Codex Leidensis (marked L. in Hassercamp’s
edition).” The licentiousness and crime that 'prevailed in Rome in the
days of Catiline, and stained his character, were so gross, that the allu-

] edons to them in this history, though few, could not fail to be offensive

Though 111 point of time, the ‚Iugurthino war took place nearly 60
years before the conspiracy of Catilina, the history of the latter is here,
