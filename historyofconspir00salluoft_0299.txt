J. Olney's Geograpm'cal Series. 21

mony of teachers that the “ Practical System of Modern Geo-
hy ’' is the best work for practical use that has ever appeared.
ut recent works have been put forth, claiming to be made upon
superior principles, and modestly intimating that all previous stand-
ard works are so inferior in construction as to render them de-
servedly obsolete. Indeed it ie claimed that there has been no ad-
vance in geographici-d text-books for many years, until suddenly a
new Daniel has come to judgment. In looking carefully over the
recent inprovements so boastfully claimed, we are unable to dis-
cover any which have not been substantially drawn from Olney’s
Geo a hies.
ffi.1})lney commenced the plan of simplifying the first lesson
and teaohing a child by what is familiar to the exclusion of astron-
omy. He commenced the plan of having only those things repre·
sented 011 the maps which the pupil was required tolcam. He
originated the system of classification, and of showing the govern-
ment, religion, &c., by symbols. He first adopted the system of
carrying the pupil' over the earth by means of the Atlas. His
works first contained cuts in which the dresS, architectum, animals,
inter-nal improvements, &Q of each country are grouped‚ so as to
be seen at one view. His works first contained the world as
known to the afficiente, as ar: aid to Ancient History, and a synopsis
of Physical Geography with maps. In short, we have seen 110
valuable feature in any geography which has not originally ap-
peared in these works; and we think it not too much to claim
that in many respects most other works are copies of these. We
think that a fair and candid examination will show that Olney's
Atlas is the largest, most systematic, and complete of any yet pub-
lished, and- that the Quarto and Modern School Geographies con-
tain more matter, and that better arranged, than any similar works.
The attention of teachers is again called to these works, and they
are deeired to test the claims here asserted.

Mr. J. Omma—Deam Sir, I have examined both your improved
School Atlas and Modern System of Geography with more than
ordinary satisfaction. Your arrangement of topics appears to me
better adapted to the comprehension of the child, and to follow
more closely the* order of nature, than any other elementary sys-
tem of the kind with which I am acquainted. Instead of having
to encounter the diagrams, problems, and definitions of Astromony
as soon as he opens his Geography, the young learner is first pre-
sented with the elements of the science in their simplest and most
attractive forms. His curiosity is of course awakened. That
which would otherwise be regarded as an irksome task, is contem-
