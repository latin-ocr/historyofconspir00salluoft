temple, οι· place consecrated by the augum, that their deliberatione
might thereby be rendered more solemn. The usual place of meeting
was the ouria Hostilia ,- but on the present occasion, they were
summoned to this temple, which was close by the Forum where the
people assembled in great numbers, and to whom, at the closo of the
meeting, Cicero came forth and stated what had been done. This

ment of harmony between the senate and the people. Hence its
name.

vere sent every where to collect the oracles of the Sibyls. From the
verses thus collected the Quindeeemviri made out new books, which
were deposited in the temple of Apollo on the Palatino hill. One of
these Oraeles stated that “three K's (Lat. C's) should reign at Rome.
