Sulloe, “Ever since the despotic rule of Lucius Sulla.” Lucius Sulla
was a Roman of patrician rank, a brave soldier, an able general, buu a
monster of cruelty. He sei-ved first in the Jugurthine war under
Marius, who became jealous of his mei-its. This originated a quari-el

appalling than any they had yet witnessed. At Rome especially,
where he seemed to act as a perfect tyrant, there was no limit to his
cruelty. About 8,000 Samnite captives were murdered in the Circus;
46 consulare, praetorians, and aediles—and 200 senators were slain5
1,600 equites were proscribed and destroyed, and 150‚000 citizens
pei-ished. In these soenes of cruelty and bloodshed‚ Catiline acted
a conspicuous part, and was thus trained for the crimes he aster-

thousands, Sulla was appointed dietatem and though in this situation

after three years he resigned the dictatorship, retii-ed to Puteoli, and
ended a misen-able privacy by a miserable death, Β. 0. 78, in the
sixtieth year of his age. See Jug. Ch. XCV. -—- 7. In dies, “Day by
