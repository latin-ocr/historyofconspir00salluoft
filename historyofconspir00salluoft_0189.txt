m 544, ΙΙ., 1. 7. Opulemia neylt'yentiam tolerabat, “Its
venia-brock& your remissum? i. e., such were the resources of the
state, that the negligence of individuale did not material] y nffect it.
8. Num vero non id ayitur, “That is not now the question :‘’
’ sed (num) haec, dte„ “ but
whether these things, of whatever sort they appear to be, are to belong
to us, or, together with ourselves, to be the prey of our enemies.”
θ. Hic mihi, dte„ “And here some one speaks to me of clemency and
mercy1” alluding to the speech of Caesar. equidmn,he1e as below
for quidem, a usage quite common in Sallust. Equidem( = eyo qui-
dem') is used properly only when the velb' 1s in the first person singu-
lun quidem is used· m all other cases: liberalitas, fortitudo¹ ᾧ 103,
R. v.: — eo . . . . in extremo (loco), ‘⁴ in such an extremity,” lit„ “to
such a degree is the state placed in extremity.’' lo. Sint sane,
“Let them be indeed.‘' ᾗ 42, Obs. 4 and 5 : ita se . . . . habent. See
ch. ΙΙ., 3: perditum eant, “hasten to destroy.” ᾧ 148, 1. Ne, in

‘⁸ By their associates in the conspiracy.’' 13. Solus non timet, dxc„
“Ee (Cesar) alone has no sear, it is the more necessary that Ι should
be concerned for myself and for you.'’ There seems here to be an in-
sinuation that if Caesar was without apprehension‚ it might arise from
his not being averse to the conspiracy. 14. Quanto . . . . tanto, dxc„
“The more vigorously you act in the present case, the less will their
com-age be.'’ §132 R. xliii„ and Obs. 6: armis (scil, tantum),
