Prof. Dodd's Algebras have received the most flattering enco-
miums from teachers who have used them in the school-roem.
They are, probably, the most clear and comprehensive works on
Algebra in print.

TESTIMONIALS.

We have introduced Dodd's Algebra into the Genesee Wes-
leyan Seminary, as a permanent text-book.
Prof. W. H. Da sz.

Dodd's Algebra possesses excellencies pertaining to no other
work.- R. H. Moomz, Ill.

I am much pleased with Dodd's Algebra, and will introduce it.
Rev. J. A. ΜοΟΑΝιΕῩ, Va.

Ι use Professor Dodd's Algebra, and shall continue it as our
regular text-book. Osoue HARms, N. J.

F'mm PBor. A. L. Hunmon, Prest. of Andr-ew Colleqe.

Ι have examined with some care Prof. Dodd’s Elements of Geo-
metry‚ and, so far as I am capable of judg'mg, I conceive it to be
in many respects decidedly the best work of the kind extant. For
simplicity‚ exactneSS, and comphteness, it can have no superior.
Like his Arithmetic and Algebra‚ in many important particulare,
his Geometry stands pre-eminent, and alone.
