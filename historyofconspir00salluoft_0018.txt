Sallust passed the close of his life, dividing his time between litei-ary
avocations and the society of his friends, among whom he numbered
Lucullus, Messala, and Cornelius Nepos. He died at the age of fifty· θ
0118, 35 years B. C. ’Δ

Of the character of Sallust, very different opinions have been forin-
ed, and the sources of information on the subject, which can now be
reached, are not the most reli-able. That he was a man of loose mox-als,
is cvidcnt3 and also that he rapaciously plundered his province, like
other Roman governors of the day. But, considering who were his
friends, and the studies he pursued, it seems highly improbable that he ⁴
indulged in that excessive libertinism which has been attributed to
him, on the erroneous supposition that he was the Sallust mentioned .
by Horace, in the first book of his Satires. Ι

Τ118 works of Sallust which have come down 10 115 entire, are the
Histoi-y of the Conspiracy of Oatiline, and the Histoi-y of the Jugurthine
War. Resides these, he was the author of a Civil and Military History
of 1118 Repufflic, in five books, embracing a period of thirteen yeme,
from the resignation of the Dictatorship by Sulla, till the promulgation
of the Manilian law, by which Pompey was invested with authority
equal to that which Sulla had relinquished. It is much to be regi-etted
that os this work—probably designed to connect the termination of the
J ngurthine war with the breaking out of the Conspiracy of Catilius—
only fragments now remain.

The first work of Sallust was the History of the Conspiracy of Cati-
linc, which broke out B. O. 62. At that time Sallust had attained the
age of twenty-tw, and was an eye-witness of the whole proeeeding.
He had therefore sufficient opportunity of ascertaining and recording,
with accuracy and truth, the origin, prqgress, and terminatffin, of the
Conspiracy. The facts detailed in the Oratione of Cicero, though dif-
fering in some minute particulare, coincide in every thing of impor-
tanc-(¹, and highly eontribute to illustrate and verify the work of the
historian. But still, living, as he did, in the midst of these scenos os
p‹›li⁴.ical sti-ise, it could hardly be expected that he should not feel per-
haps too much interested in the fortunes of individuals and parties to
fulffl the duties of an impartial writer; and that this was so, to some
extent, 1118 feeble and apparently reluctant commendation which Ι118
bestows on Cicero, then, as well as now, acknowledged to be the prin-
cipa] actor in detecting and frustrating the Oonspiracy, 15, abundant
evidence. Although not an eye-witness to the war with Jugurtha,
which took place nearly fifty years before the Conspiracy of Catilina,
