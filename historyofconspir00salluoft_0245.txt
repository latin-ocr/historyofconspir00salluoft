 

JUGURTHINE wan: 233

Roman passus was two steps—the distance the foot reaches from the
[point where it is raised in walkiug, to the point where it is set down.
'Phe Roman mile was 1618 yards lacking three inches, 01· about 142
yards less than the English mile: dum . . . . poenas caperent,
“until they should take satisfaction‚’' “inflict punishment upou.’'
3. In primo late (ire), “To march in front with an extended l‚ine’' (lit,
“ widely ”)‚ soil, so as to conceal the infantry behind them: -κ
artissime, i. e.‚ arctissime.

 

 

lex.—l. Animum advertere, smne as animadvertere .· ad se
versum, as before by tmesis for adversum se, “towards themselves :'’
obvii procedunt, “go forth to meet him.“ 2. Alii—alii—
pars, as before, distributing equites, peditesque. 3. Laetati (sunt) :
— cumea poenoe aut proedoe fuit, “ was wholly given up to the sword
(lit, punishment), or to plunder.‘' Poenae fuit is unusual, and admissi-
ble here only because connected with proedoe, which is common.
«ί. Qzoem, ‘⁴ Wh0‚’' subject of profuyisse : dicere causam, “to
plead his cause ;” to account for his conduct, or to defend himself from
the accusation brought against him: sese parum expuryat, “he
does not clear himself :’' capite poenas solvil. Plutarch says, that
this result was chiefly the work of Marius, and much against the will
of Metellus, who had a great regal-d for Turpilius. Marius urged and
carried this, not from opposition to Turpilius, or zeal for the Roman
discipline, but to vex Metellus. It was unlawful to scourge or put to
death a Roman citizen without the order of the people. Sallust
accounts for the proceedings in the present case thus, Nam is civis ex

Latio erat, audit would appear from this, that these had not the full
right of Roman citizens.
