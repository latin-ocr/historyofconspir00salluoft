punishment, at least for the present, recommended that they should be
held in custody, the guards strengthened, and when the conspiracy
should be put down, they would then resume and decide the question.
Gaesar was opposed to capital punishment altogether, aad advises}
imprisonment for life. His speech (see next chapter) was ingenious
