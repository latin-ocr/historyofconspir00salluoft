of the commone, by powerful efforts turned the scale, For the speech
of Cato see Ch. LII., and its results, Ch. LIII. -——— ἵ. qumoemodi
verba locutus osc, “Spoke to this effeet.” The word mquxmodi inti-
mates that the speech of Caesar which follows is netto be considered as
given in his very words, but only as to the general sense of it as near
as could be remembered.

L1.—1. Patres Conscripti—iz title by which the senators assembled
were addressed, supposed to have been originally Patres et Gomcripti.
By Patres is meant members of the senate as originally constituted by
Romulus, and by Oonscriptz', those afterwards added by Brutus. —
2. Neque quisquam omnium, dic„ “And of all men, no one has ever
been subservient to his passione, and his interest at the same time.”
The term libido, in its general sense, means desire, feeling, inclinativa ,-
and to act ex libidine is to aet under the influence of feeling or passion,
such as anger, sear, Pity, or the like, as opposed to acting from sound
judgment and discretion, or a sense of duty or proprietyf — 3. Ubi
intenderieinyenium,scil.‚ in verum. 4. Male consuluerint, ‘⁶ Have
formed bad resolutions.’' ⁵. Ne quis divitiarum, die„ “That no

 

 

one might say the war was undertaken more on account of their liches,
than of any injury (done to us)’' 6. Per inducias, “During the
time of 'a truce :‘’ -— per occasionem, “when opportunity offered:”
— talia fecere, “retaliated,'’ lit„ “did such things,'' scil„ to them,
as they did to us. ⁷. Neu consulatis, “And that you do not con-
sult.” 8. Diyna pro sactis. §- 119, Explanation: ——— novum
consilium, ‘⁴ the new measures.'' Caesar here represents it as something
new to punish with death for political offences, as Silanus proposed.
But this was not precisely so; for Cicero represents Silanus ss remind-
ing the senate Ιιοσ yenus pomoe ωερε in ‘Improbos cives esse usurpatum
(IV.Or. in Cat„ Ch. IV): —-— utendum his, scil„ impnsonment and exile.
—- 9. Pati, quae (i. e., ea quoe), “Suffered such indignities δι” § 31,
Obs. 2, last part„ -— lo. An (eo pertinuit) uti vos, dcc„ “Was this
its object, to make you hostile to the conspiracy 8¹³ Scilicet, “ Yes,
forsooth.'’ This word is here strongly ironical: —— eae φαινέτω oequo
habuere, “have felt them too severely‚” lit, “have regarded them more
seriously than was right? ll. Alia aliis licentia est, “All have not
the same freedom;” lit„ “one degree of freedom is to some persons,
and another to others” § 98, Obs. 11: -——- demissi, “in humble sta-
tion:’' —- iracundia, ablativo of cause: ——— studere, “to fsvor:”
paulo severior. § 134, Obs. 6, 2d. —— 12. Studio rei publicae,
