provinces. To prevent this in future, C. Sempronius Gracchus got a
law passed, B. o. 122, ordaining that the senate should determine the
two provinces sor the future consuls before their election. The con-
suls afterwards themselves determined their respective provinces by
lot or agreement. 5. obvenit, “ F ell to the lot.'’ Italy was not
a province in the ordinary sense of vhe term. But the consul under
whose administration it was placed remained at Rome, and was to be
ready for any war that might break out: scribitur, “is levied‚''
“enrolled :’' stipendium, “ money.'' Stipendium from stips, “a small
coin‚'’ in military language, means “ money for the pay of the army.”

ambassadors of J ugurtha should be heard at all : deditum (supine),
