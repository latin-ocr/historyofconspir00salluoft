5120„ R. xxiv.: -- dmni, scil„ Romoe: non mediocrem ani-
mum, “the ambitione mind :'’ —— pollicitando. Note the force of the
frequentative: occidisset (from occido, not occido), ‘⁴ should die :'’
-—- fore, uli solus, nire. This clause depends on pollicigando. ᾧ 145,
obs, 6. -— 2. Donatum atquc laudatum maynifice‚ “Be'mg loaded
with presente and lauded in the highest style :'’ pro concione,
“publiely,” lit„ “in presence of the assembly :” —— iu proetorium,
“into his tent.” 3. Publice quam privatim, ‘¹ Publicly rather
than privately,” i. e., by publio services rather than by private interest.
--— 4. Neu quibus (sor aliquibus) laryiri insuesceret, “And that he
should not make a practice of giving bribes to individuals.” There
was doubtless need for this advice ς and Scipio probably had seen with
displeasure the intimacy between Jugurtha and certain young ambi-
tious Romans of doubtful character. 5. Periculose a paucis, dcc.
Arrange and supply thus, (id ace. subject of emi) quod esset multorum
(ᾗ 108, R.. xii.) emi periculose a paucis.- in suis (bonis) artibus,
suamet pecunia, “ by the very means

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

“in his virtuous practices :”
of his money.”

the preceding clause:

“both by the merit- and the popularity of the man] 3. Morbo
atquc aetate consectus‚‘ ‘Exhausted with siekness and age? Im-
juacmodi verba cum Juyartha habui-esest ‘to have spoken with J ugurtha
to this effeet.” Habere seems to be a favolite word with Sallust, and
verba habere ιε sometimes used' m the sense of orationem habere. The
use of cum with Juyurtha intimates that this was spoken in eonversa-
tion.

 

10—1. Parvum, “When a child :‘' -- in meum regnum, “into
my kingdom,” viz„ as one of my heirs. This was not exactly true, for
che history. Ch. V11.‚ shows he had far other views, and this was well
understood by Jugurtha, as is mentioned in the next chapter:
quam si (te) qenai-roem, ‘⁴ than if Ι had been your futhei-‚⁹² Most editions
aster quam insert liberis, making the meaning, “than to my children,
if Ι should have any.'’ This seems to be foreed, and gives ground to
suspect that liberis is an interpolation} neque ea res falsum mc
