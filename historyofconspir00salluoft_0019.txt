yet his situation as Proetor of Numidia, which had been the scene of
this war, afforded him an opportunity of collecting materials, and pro-
curing information, while his distance in point of time from the men
and parties of that period, was favorable for obtaining just and com-
prehensive vicws of the exciting events of the war, and for cmbodying
them in a faithful and impartial narrative.

Sallust, like some other historians of antiquity, evidently regarded
an elegant style as one os the chief mei-its of an historical work. His
own style, on which he took so much pains, was carefully formed on
that of Thucydides, whose manner of writing was in a great measure
original, and, till the time of Sallust, peculiar to himself. The Roman
has wonderfully succeeded in imitating the vigor and conciseness of
the Greek historian, and infusing into his composition something of
that dignity and austerity which distinguishcs·the works of his great
model. This imitation, however, consiste more in the rapid and com-
pressed manner in which his narrative is conducted, than in the struc-
ture of his sentences—in brevity of idea, rather than of language. For
while Thucydides frequently employs long and involved periods, Sal-
lust is abrupt and sententious, and is generally considered as having
carried this sort. of brevity to excess. The use of copulatives, for the
purpose of uniting clauses or sentences, is in a 'great measure rejected;
antiquated forms of expression, and words considered nearly obsolete,
are sometimes employed, so that ou the whole there is too much appear-
ance of study, and the want of that ease and natural gracefulness so
pleasing in the productions of some other writers·

In the delineation of character, Sallust particularly excels, Some
of the characters drawn by him have been regarded in all ages as
master-picces of their kind. The portraits of Catiline, Jugurtha, and
Marius, convey to us vivid ideas of their minds and persons, and pre
pare us to anticipate, in some degree, how each will act in the situa-
tion in which he is placed. In Catiline, we behold a man of a bold,
profligate, untamable spirit; of infinite resources, unwearied applica-
tion, and prevailing address. We see, as it were, before us the deadly
paleness of his countenance, his ghastly eye, his unequal, troubled step,
and the distraction of his whole appearance, strongly indicating the
recklesshorror of a guilty conscience. The introductory sketeh of the
genius and manners of Jugurtha, is no less able and spirited than that
of Catiline. We behold him serving under Scipio, at Numantia, as
brem, accomplished, and enter-prising;but imbued with an ambition
which, being under no control of principle, hurried him into its worck
