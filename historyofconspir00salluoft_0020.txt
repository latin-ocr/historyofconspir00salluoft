excesses, and rendered him ultimately perfidious and cruel. The most
singular part os his character was, the mixture of boldness and irresolu-
tion which it combined; but the lesson we receive from it, lies in the
misci-ies of that suspicion and remorse which he had created in his own
mind by his atrocities, and which rendered him ss wretched⁶ on the
throne, or at the head of his army, as in the dungeon where he termi-
nated his unhappy lise. The portraits of the other principnl characters
who figured in the Jugurthine war, are all well brought out. Thnt of
Marius in particular is happily touched. The parallel drawn between

Cato and Caesar is one of the most celebrated passages in the history of ἱ

the Conspiracy.

The subjecte chosen by Sallust form two os the most important and
prominent topice in the history of Rome. The periods, indeed, which
he describes were painful, but they were interesting. Full of con-
spiracies, usurpatione, 'and civil wars, they chiefly exhibit. the mutual
ruge and iniquity of embittered fuctions, furious struggles between the
patricians and plebeiaus, open corruption in the senate, venality in the
eom-ts of justice, and rapine in the provinces. This state of things, so
forcibly painted by Sallust, produced the Conspi1·ncy‚=and even, in
some degree, formed the character of Cutiline. But it was the oppres-
sive ‹lebts of iudividuals, the temper of Sulla's soldiers‚ and the absence
of Pompey with his army, which gave a possibility, aud even a pro&
pect of success to a plot which affected the vital existence of the com-
monweahh, and which, although ari-ested in its commencement, was
one of those violent shocks which hasten the fall of a state. The his-
tory of the Jugurthine war exhibits a more extensive field of action,
and a greater theatre of war, though the war itself was not so impor—
tant or menacing to the vital interests and immediate safety of Rome.
No prince, except Mithridates, gave so much employment to the
Roman arms. In the course os no war—not even the second Cartha-
ginien—were the people more desponding, and in none were they more
elated with success. As a piece of composition this narrative desei-ves
to mul( very high. Nothing can be more interesting than the account
of the vicissitudes of this conte-st. The talents. the endless resourees,
the total want of principle, the sufferings of conscience—all found eom-
bined in the character and condition of Jugurtha—-stand fortha'n vivid
and picturesque colom, and convey a moral leesor not easily to be
effuced.
