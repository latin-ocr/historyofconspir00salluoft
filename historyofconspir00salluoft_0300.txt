22 J. Olney’s Geographz'cal Series.
pl·1tesl with pleasnre. The opening mind exulte in the exer-eise of
its fiq011lties,and in the ease with which it every day guthers new
intellcotual treasures. The constant use which you oblige the
child to make of his Atl·,rs Iconsider of a great advantage, and
the substitution of initials for the names of countries, mountains,
rivers, dte„ a valuable improvement. There is, moreover, a con-
densition of matter throughout, combined with a clearness and
simplicity which cannot fail, I think, of being highly appreciated
by all enlightened and judicious teachers. Your method of desig-
nating the length of the principal rivers is extremely simple and
conv enient.

 

From the Oonnoetimt Mirror.

As an elementary work, we certainly never have seen any of
the kind that will compare with it. Simplicity is its leading fea-
ture, and instruction its real object. It is adapted to the humblest
capacity, and may be studied in connection with the Atlas, almost
as advantageously by children as by those of a maturer age. We
are not accustomed to speak in terms of praise of every new
school-book which appears, for it is countenancing the practice
of taxing parents, no matter how heuvily, for the sake of chanao.
But in the case of Mr. Olney’s Geography, we are so well satisfied
that it is just what is wanted in our common schools, that we
really account it our duty to aid in introducing it.

I have long thought Olney's Geography and Atlas a first-rate
school· book, and the gpublishers of it have certainly given to it an
attractive appearance 'to the teacher and pupi1.1 have used it, 1
think, nearly ten years of my teaching, and always found the suc·
cessive editions reliable for aecuracy, and wil {14ng the timeo.
