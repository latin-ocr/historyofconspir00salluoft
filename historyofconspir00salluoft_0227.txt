ssoeuntry on the western shore of the Euxine sea, between Mount Hae-

mus on the north and Propontis on the south. ’ἵ- Centurio primi
pili, “The centurion of the first 1·ank,” i. e.‚ the chief centurion. The
Roman legion consisted of ten cohorte, and each cohort, of three mani·
ples, of which, when drawn up in battle array, that which stood ir
the foi-ernost rank consisted of hastati, that in the second, of principes

 

’ -and that in the third, of triarii or pilani, each of which had its centurio,
sometimes two, named from the line to which he belonged. The lines

were separated by a considerable space between, and engaged the
enemy separately. If the first was overpowered and driven back, the
second came forwm·d; if that was driven back, the third line, consist-
ing of the trian‘i, old soldiers of approved valor, kept in reserve, fresh
and vigel-cus, fell upon the exhausted enemy, and usually turned the '
tide of battle. The centurion or captain of this maniple was called
murio primi pili, or chief centuriom he had charge of the eagle or
chief standard, ranked among the equites, and had a place in the coun-
dl of war with the consul and tribunes. The treachery of such an
officer may therefore be deemed the more surprising, and the more
dimetrous. —— 8. Per munitionem, &e Arrange, Dedit lwetibua locum
