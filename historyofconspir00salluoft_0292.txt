14 Enos‘s Intellectual and Praetical Arithmetic. ’

Schell's Introduotory Lessons in &immone—(81 00·)

Designed as an introduction to the study of any mental Vr written
Arithmetic. It contains a large amount of mental quv ons, toge-
ther with a large number of questions to be performed on the
slate3 thus combining mental and written exercises for young be-
ginners. This is a very attracti-ve little book, superior to any of
its class. It leads the pupil on by the easiest steps possible, and

yet insures constant progreSS.

REOOMME NDATIONS.

Ι have carefully examined the manuscript of “⁴Schell’s Intro-
ductory Lessons in Arithmetic‚’' and am convinced that it is alto-
gether superior to any text-book of the kind with which I am ao-
quainted. It is peculiarly adapted to the wants of beginners, the
language being simple, the definitione clear, the examples easy, and ,
the transition from one subject to another gradual and natural.
I cannot too much commend the system which the author has
adopted throughout, of fully illustrating every principle as he ad-
vances‚ by numerous mental and written exer-cisse, rendering
thereby one rule perfectly familiar before he passes to the next.

It is unnecessary to do more than to ask the attention of teaehers
to this work; they cannot examine it impartially without being
convinced of its superior merite. It will, no doubt, become one

of the most popular of school-books.
