TESTIMONIALS.
From Doni-son mmm, LL. D„ President of Yale Colleqe.

“I have perused your work on Meteorology, which you were
so kind as to send me, and am much pleased with the manner in
which you have treated these subjeots3 the selection of topics being
in my view judicious, and the style luminous‚ and well adapted to

‘⁶ Professor Brocklesby‚ of Trinity Oollege, has submitted to my
perusal a ‘ Treatise on Meteorology‚' written by himself, and with
the arrangement and soience of which I am much pleased. The
Professor wishes to have his treatISe published as a school-book,
and, considering the interest which the several subjeets it em-
braces excites in the minds of all, both old and young, rich and
poor, I see not why such a book, when once introduced, should not
have a large circulation. I see no reason why Meteorology‚ in
many respects, has not as many claims as a school-book as Chem-
