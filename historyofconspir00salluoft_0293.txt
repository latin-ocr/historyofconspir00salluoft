REOOMMENDATIONS.

⁸ I have examined with care and interest, Enos's Mental Arith-

metic, and shall introduce it at once into the Academy.
Prof. O. M. Wmen‘r.

We have examined an intellectual Arithmetic‚ by J. L. Enos,
and like it much. We shall immediately use it in our school.
Prof. D. I. Pxxomxmr,
S. M. FELLows,
S. Saxum,

Having usedTanos‘s Mental Arithmetic in my school, Ι believe
it to be superior to all other works of the kind.

Whitlock's Geometry and Surveying‚—(e1 50.)
Is a work for advanced studente possessing the. highest claims upon

' the attention of Mathematical Teachers. In comparison with other
» works of the kind, it presente the following advantages:

1. A better connected, and more progressive methed of geo-
metrizing‚ calculated to enable the student to go alone.

2. A fuller, more varied and available practice, by the intro-
duction of more than four hundred exercises‚ arithmetical, demon-
strative and algebraical, so chosen as to be serviceable rather than
amusing, aud so arranged as greatly to aid in the acquisition of thc
theory.

3. The bringing together of such a body of geometrica] know-
ledge, theoretioal and practical‚ as every individual on enter-ing into
active life demands.

4. A system os sarz-eyinq which eavea two thio-ds the labor ‘re-
quired hy the ordinary process.

This work is well spoken of universally‚ and is already in use in
some of the best institutions of this country. It is recommended
by Prof. Pierce, of Omnbridge3 Prof. Smitb, of Middletown3 Prof.
Dodd, of Lexington, aud many other eminent mathematicians.

From E. M. Mensa, Eso :-1 consider that I have obtained more
mathematical knowledge from Whitlock’s Geometw, than from all
other text-books combined. Unlike too many treatises of a similar
nature, it is eminently calculated to make maclaematioians.
