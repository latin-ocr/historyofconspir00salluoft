first written, but because it is more genera. *y read than thesei-mer.
Besides, in a course of classica} reading, it should always be read be-
fore the Orations of Cicero against Catiline ; and where only one of these,
histories is read, this one should bc, and generally will be preferred.

Passages in the form of oblique nari-atlon (ἓ 141, R. vi. Expl.), as
in Prof. Andrews' edition, are indicated by single quotation marks}
direct quotations, by double quotation marks. The method of distin-
guishing adverbs, and the ablative singular of the firstdeclension by
accents, has not been used, as, at this stage of his studies, the student is
, supposed to have such a knowledge of syntax as to be able to make
these distinctions for himself, without such artificia] aid.

In preparing the notes and illustrations appended, the editor has ’
availcd himself of all the assistance furnished by the various editions
in use in this country, and of some foreign editions also, especially that
of Zumpt above referred to; and, as this author is usually read in an
early stage of the Academical course, greater fulness in the notes has
been deenied proper. Care has been taken, however, not to supersede
diligence and efl'ort on the part of the learner, but to encourage both,
by giving the assistance necessary to render the study of this author
interesting and profitablc, and to relieve the¹ macher, in some degree,
by supplying just such information as the intelligent student would
likely scek to obtain from him. The translations given are, in general,
sufficiently litei-al to indicate the construction; sometimes a strictly
litei-al translation is annexed. The references to the Editor's Latin
Grammar, for the explanation of peculiar or more difficult construc-
tions and forms of speech, are numerous. They have the usual section
mark (ξ) prefixed, and will be easily understood. References from one
part of the book to another for explanation, are common, and made by
indicating the chapter in Roman numerals, and if to a note, by annox
ing in figures the number of the note, to the number of the chapter·;
thus, Chap. 1., 2 (p. 141), is a reference to note 2, under Chap. L, found
p. 139.

Front⁰ing the title-page is a map of Numidia, from the Edinburgh
edition, which will be useful to point out the localities mentioned in
the angui-thina war. No pains or expense has been spat-ed to render
the work accurate and atti-active; and the style in which it is pross
duced by the printer and publishers, will compare favorably with that
of any similar publicatione of the presen'· day. ⁷
