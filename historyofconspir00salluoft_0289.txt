gre· ttly improved nomenclature.

3. The clear and concise manner in which principles are stated
and explanation-s are given.

4. Brevity and completeness of rules.

5. The distinctum with which the true connection between

“ Upon a oareful examination of a manuscript Treatise on
Arithmetic by Prof. Dodd, I find it greatly superior to all others
which have come under my notice, in system, completeness and
nomenclatore. The arrangement is natural, the system complete,
and the nomenclature greatly improved. These improvement-s ‹co-e
not ahma,- they are fundamental—eminently worthy the attention
of the Mathematical Teacher‚ and give a character of unity to the
work, which at once distinguishes it from all others on this subject.

‘⁵ Ι believe it admirably adnpted to the purposes of instruction3
infact, by far the most convenient and mable book· for teacher and
pupil I have yet met with ,· and will, with great pleasure, adopt it
in the Institute, and recommend its adoption by all.’'
