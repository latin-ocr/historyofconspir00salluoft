Jugurtha oonoealed imperfectly by the brushwood. Deseending from
the mountain, on his march eastward to the river, Metellus discovered
its position in time to prevent his falling into the snare, and to make
preparatione. He speedily drew up his men in order of battle, in three
lines, as usual, by causing those on the right side next the enemy
simply to face to the right, and so form a fron't line faeing the enemy3
and the other two lines behind them in the same manner. (See Ch.
XXXVIII„ 7.) Thus arranged, they were put into a marching column
three abi-east by simply fucing to the left, and thus oonverting the
frout line into the right flank (transversis principiis) marched down
into the plain in front of Jugurtha’s army, and ready in an instant, if
attaeked, to halt, face to the right, and so convert the column again
into a triple line saeing the enemy. 7. Inter manipulos, “ Between

flank,’' scil„ as they marched towards the river: lassitudinem et
sitim militum tentaturos, ‘⁴ would try the effect of the weariness and
thirst of the soldiers.” The meaning is, that as they (the soldiers of
J ugurtha) had no confidence in their arms, they would try by harnes·
ing and delaying them on their march, in a sandy plain, where no
water could be procui-ed, to effect their destruction from this cause.
