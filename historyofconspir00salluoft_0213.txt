JUGURTHINE wan. 201

xvim—1. Quis (for quibus) cibus, &e.‚ lit„ “To whom the food
m the flesh of wild beasts, and, as to cattle, the productions of the
ground ²‘ (as hei-bs, roots, dcc), i. e.‚ who fed on the flesh of wild beasts,
and, like cattle, on the products of the ground. Uti pecoribus refers
only to humi pabulum: cujusquam limite only imperio.
Ξ. Herodes, dic. This of course is wholly fabulous:
”tultis sibi quisque impe-rium petentibus “and every where many aim-
ing at command, each for himself.'' Quisque here, in the nominative,
isasingular construction; regularly it would be quoque in the same
case with multis which it distributes. ᾧ 98, Exe. 4, in fin.: dilabi-
tur, “melta away,'' “eomes to nothing.’' 3. Ετε eo numero, scil„
the army of Hercules. 4. Intra Oceanum, “Upon (lit, within)
the Atlantia ocean‚'’ in part surrounded or enclosed by it‚—-1neuning
the part· west of the Sti-aits of Gibraltar:
bottom up :’' cop-ia, “facilityt'' iynara lingula, ‘⁴ un un-
known language.’' synon-ns commonly active in signification (“n0t
knowing ’') is here passive (“unknown ’‘). 5. Per connubia, ‘¹ By
intermarriages:” tentantes agros, &e.‚ “making trial of the lauds
(ἰ. e.‚ the pasturage), they had gone to one place, then to another,”—
shisted about from place to place: semet ipsi Nomadas appellavere,
“they called themselves Nomades,” or “N01nads.” This term from
νομός, “pasture,'’ is applied by the Greeks to pastoral tribes who have
uo settled Ahabstation, but move about from place 10 plac-e in search of
pastura for their floeks. 6. Adhuc, “To this day :”
“buta” properly, “mssvable huts,” as mayalia means “fixed abodes.'’
Both words are of Punic origin: oblonya. Arrange, sunt oblonga,
dm: incurvis lateribus tecta, &e.‚ “ gathered up into a roos, with sides
bcnding like the hulls of ships,'’ lit„ “as if the hulls of ships.’'
⁸¹1. Accexsere Libyes, “Joiued themselves to the Libyans.'’ Libyes (from
Libys), the acc. pl. governed by ad in composition (ad-cessere) .· pro-

scil„ Medorum : Mauros pro Medis appellantes, “by calling them
(ὁ 146, Obs. 6, last part) Mauri instead of Medi.” This is a very im-
probable origin of the word Mauri. Bochai-t, with more probability,
derives it from Maubai-im, “the surthest people,” as they lived on the
