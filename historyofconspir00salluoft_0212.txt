was not then discovered: pauci tantummodo, supply eliserunt, or
volamtnt: sed Africam (esse) in Europa. The northern parts
only of Africa were then known. The early writers divided the earth,
as here mentioned, into two parts. Thus Varro, L. L., 4, Ut omnis
natura in. coelum et terram divisa est, sic coelum in reqioneg terra in
Asiam et Europam. 4. Ea, “Itss’ scil„ Africa: fretum nostri
mari-w, dte„ “the sti-ait connecting our sea (the Mediterraneum, so called,
because Italy stretehed out into it) and the (Atlantic) ocean‚” viz„ the
fre-tum Gaditanum or Herculeum, the Straits of Gibraltar: decli-
vem latitudinem, “a wide sloping tract:'' Catabathmon (Greek
Καταβαέιμόν, “a desoent''), “Catabathmus ” (maynus). This slope or
reg-ion separated Cyrenaica from Egypt, and was regarded by Sallust
as the linxit of Africa to the west3 and this shows that Egypt was not
then considered as a part of Africa„ but belonged to Asia.
5. Mare soevum, importuosum, “The sea was stormy, ill-supplied with
harbors:”

quanquam ab ea fama, dxc„ “although (the aceount) is different from
that story which holds possession of most persons‚’' i. e., which gener-
ally prevails. Diversum agrees with, and interpretatum est has for its
subject, the preceding part of the sentence, qui mortales, dzc.; hence
the neuter gender; for the subjunctive3‚ habuerint, accesserint, permixti
sint, see d} 140, 5: qui reyis Hiempsalis (esse) dicebantur, “which
were said to have belonged to king Hiempsal,''—not the one already
mentioned, who was killed by Jugurtha; but a later descendant of
Masinissa, who ruled after Jugurtha and was still alive in the time of
Cicero, about Β. c. 60: rem sese habere, “the thing is.'' Se habere,
in imitation of the Greek ἑαυτὸ ἔχειν, means “to be,’‘ lit„ “to have
itself.” ῒ. Fides ejus rei, &Q “The truth of that statement will
rest with the authors themselves,'’—as much as to say, ¹1 do not voueh
for the truth of it.⁷ Sallust was prudent to throw the responsibility
qn his authorities; for the account here given of Africa would not
have gained for him the reputation of aceuracy.
