i. e„ Sulla. 3. Con-*mlta sese omnia, &e., “That he was keeping
every subject of discussion with him untouehed‚” i. e., he was deter-
mining nothing by himself, but leaving every thing to be settled in
conference with him—consulta, subs. consultum. 4· Neu Juyurthoe,
&e., ‘⁶ In order that the common business might be transacted (between
them) more freely‚ that he should disi-egard the muhassador of J ugur-
tha (whom he allowed at his court), sor otherwise precaution could not
be taken against his inti-igues.” Bocchus here represents that the pre-
sence of the envoy of Jugurtha at his court need be no obstacle to the
free discussion of their common affairs, that he permitted his presence
asa matter of poliey, to prevent suspicion on the part of Jugm-tlm.
Whereas if he were dismissed, or not suffered to be present, his suspi-
cions would be awakened, and there would be constant trouble and
danger from his intrigues. In this sentence also the readings are vari-
ous, aud the true meaning not well settled. 5. Mayis Punica
fide, &e., ‘⁴‘ More with treacherous intent, than for the reasons he pre-
tended, kept both the Romans and Jugurtha amused with the hope of
peaoe.” Punica fides is the same thing as mala fides, and a sort of·
proverbial expression to denote treachery and perfidiousness— the
Carthagininns being regarded by the Romans as eminently perfidious
und deeeitful. ὃ. Libidinem adversum nos, &e., “That his inelina-
tion urged him against us-—his sear pleaded in our fav01·.'’
