From the Soathern Repertory and Colleqe Review, for
December, 1852.

“ Bullions’ Series of Grammars and Elementary Classica, through the
kindness of the publishers, have been placed upon our table. Although
we have been familiar with some os Bullions' books for years, we have
not had until now the opportunity of examining the entire series of
grammars. This examination we have made with much pleasu1·e,which
increased as we progressed. We think that these books ought. to be in-
troduced into our primary sehools, academies, and eolleges forthwith,
even to the exclusion of others, which were good ‘in their day‚' but
which have got behind the times. Every teaeher has experieneed the
incmwenienee, and every student has felt the embarrassment, arising
from a change of textebooks from one autfior to another, on the same
subject.. True, principles may be ever the same; but each author has ‘
his own mode of expression and illustration—eaeh has his lan.

“ In izhe series one uniform plan is pursued through t e grammars
of the English, Latin, and Greek languages. The young beginner who
masters the Praetieal Lessons in English Grammar, is not only repared
for the Analytieal and Praetieal Grammar, and the still higher xereises
in Analysis and Parsing, but can take hold of the Latin and Greek
Grammars, with a good knowledge beforehand of the plan to be pur-
sued. We are for Bullions' books, as well as for some others, which we
hope hereafter to notice, issued from the press of those excellent book-
makers, Farmer, Braoe dr. Co„ late Pratt, Woodford ἀ Co.’'
