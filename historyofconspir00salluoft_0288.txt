From the Now York Chao-ahman.

Of all the German Grammars we have ever examined, this is
the most modest and unpretending—and yet it contains a system
and a principle which is the life of it, as clear, aspractical, as effec-
tive for learning Grammar as any thing we have ever seen put
forth, with so much more pretence of originality and show of phi-
losophy. In travelling from England to Germany, a man might
commence his Journey in England: he must first pass' through
those parts which lie most contiguous to the land to which he is
going: he should cross the separating line at the point or points
where the two adJ'acent countries have most features in common,
and Lis first explorations in the new land will be in those quarters
which reinind him most of the soenes and associations from which
he is ‹leparting. This is the pervading principle of the (drammar
before us, and, truism as it may appear, it contains the secret of
the easy acquisition of a foreign language, especially one that has
many affinities both in words and idionis to our own.

The principle on which this book is grounded gives it a strong
claim to every teacher through examination. It will be found,
too, we think, thst the author has not only presented a new idea
of much interest in itself, but has admirably carried it out in the
practical lessons and exercises of his work.

From Professor J. Foster, of Scheneotady.

I have examined Prof. Peissner’s German Grammar with some
attention, have marked with interest the rapid advancement of
student-3 here using it as a text-book, and have myself carefully
tested it in the instruction of a daughter eleven years of age. The
result is a conviction that it is most admirably adapted to secure
easy, pleasant and real progress, and that from no other work
which has come under my notice can so satisfactory a knowledge
of the language be obtained in a given time.

From the Albany Morninq Exprese.

This is one of the very best treatises of its kind now extant.
These who are acquainted with the science and practice of lan-
guage will need but a simple statement of some of its points, in
order to appreciate its superior merit.

From the Schenectady Refleotor.

It seems to us to meet more successfully than any other Gram
mar, the case of those who desire an accurate knowledge and prac-
