Ch. L.: ’--- ᾰσάασὶί, quietus exornat, and remittit, all belong to Bo-
milcar: quid ubique hostis aqeret (ὁ 140, 5), “what the enemy
(scll.‚ the Romans) were doing evei-y where.'’ It will be obem-ved that
by hostis Sallust does not always mean those opposed to the Romans,
but those opposed to the party of whom he speaks at the time: hence
it sometimes means the Romans, and sometimes the Numidiam:
et auimo vacuum, “ aud was free from apprehension.” —-— fl. Verum

tacked by Jugmtha: arte (for arcte) statuerat, “ he had placed in
close order? — quo hostium itineri officeret, “to obstruet the pas-
sage of the euemy,'' i. e„ of Rutilius, should he return to tho meist
anee of Metellus. This clause depende on porrigit, not on ctatverat
Ari-ange thus, quo efficeret itinera· hostium, porr-iyit latius aciem, quam
diffidere-*e virtuti militum, statuerat arte.
