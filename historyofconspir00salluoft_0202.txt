V.—1. Bellum scripturae sum, “I am about to write a history of
the war‚” lit, “the war.'' For the particular idea expressed by the
periphrastic conjugation, see ᾧ 79, 8'. During the progress of this war,
there was commencing at Rome that struggle between the popularet
and the optimates which was in the end carried on with such senseless
vehemence, that only the devastation of Italy put a stop to the civil
discord (studiis civilibus), and that only a military despotism (first of
Caesar and afterwards of the triumvirate) was able to restore peace.

which the Romans sustained severe reverses from the Carthaginians
under Hannibal, in the battles of Trebia, the lake Thrasymenus, and
Cannae, but were at last victorious in the decisive battle of'Zamg
which terminated the war in Β. c. 201. For fifty years aster this, there
was no open war between Rome and Oarthage; but neither was there
any cordial peace3 on the contrary there was constant jealousy and
suspicion.-·Carthage again violated the former treaty by sending a
