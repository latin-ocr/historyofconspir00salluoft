potestas restituta eat. The office of tribunes of the people was insti-
tuted on the occasion of the first secession to Mons Sacer, B. c. 493

height, till it was greatly abridged by Sulla, and continued so, till,
as here mentioned, it was in a great measure restored in the con-
sulship of Pompey and Crassus. This restoration, though hailed
with favor by the people, was disapproved by Cicero and others,

toole in the hands of the ambitious and powerful. 2. Summam
