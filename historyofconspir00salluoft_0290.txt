‘⁴ Ι have examined Dodd’s Arithmetic‚ and am fully persuaded
that it is superior to any other with which Ι am acquainted. I
could speak in detail were it necessary3 but all that ie required
to establish its reputation and inm-oductz'on, is tq have it known by
Teaohere.’⁷ O. M. Wmenr, Imt.

From tho Facuzty of Book River &minan-y.

“Upon an examination of Prof. Dodd’s Arithmetic‚ we have
come to the conclusion that its superior ανναηρθνηεηι, the alearness
of its rules and explanations, and its improved nomenclatura, entitle
itte the oareful consideration of the Mathematical Teacher: that
these improvements distinguish it from all others that have come
under our notice. We therefore give it our coi-dial approbation,
and shall introduce it immediately into our Seminary.’'

“ Dodd’s High School Arithmetic is better adapted to supssly the
wants of High Schools and Academies than any other Arit metio
which I have ever met. His rules are plain, concite, definitely
stated, and fully illustrated with examples.’'
