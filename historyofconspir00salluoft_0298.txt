VIEWS OF THE MIOROSOOPIO WORLD.—(81 12.)

Desiqnedfor Gener-al Readiny, and as a Hand-book· for mames in
Natural Scienoes. By Prof. Bnooxmsmr.

By the aid of a powerful microscope, the author has given us
highly instructive accounts of Infusorial Animalcules, Fooeil In-
fussoria, Minute Aquatio Animae, &ructare of Wood and Herbs,
Crystallizatiom parts of Imm, ὤα, ὥσ.

To those who are necessarily deprived of the aid of a micro-
soope‚ and even to those who have it, this is a most valuable work.
It is clearly and pleasantly written. The sections on the Animal-
cules, I nfusoria, and Crystallizations, are very beautifully illustrated
with large and expensive plates. The decriptions of the different
kinds of these wonderful little animals, many of which multiply by
millions in a few hours, are really very instructive. There is no

better school library book in the world. It should be read by
every man, woman, and child.
