Ι nse Bullions' works—all of them—and consider them 1110 best
ottho kind that have been iaeued in this or any other languago.
If they were unirer-«augy used we would not have so many super-
ficial scholam, and the st-udy of the class-ies would be more likely
to serve the end for which it was desigued—the strengthening :ind
adorning of the mind. J. B. Tnomsox‚ A. M„

Oooper's virgil, with English Kotes-(2 oo.)

Having examined the Rev. J. G. cooper’s edition of the works
of virgil, I have 110 hesitation of giving my opinion, that the plan
which 110 has pursued is excellent, and the execution highly oredit-
nble to his talents and scholarship. Such a work will greatly
facilitate the stnzly of the poet, 011 1110 part of the youthful learner.

, 11 will give him 11 correct idea of the meaning of the author in the

more difficult passages and by its copious notes upon ancient his-
tory and mythology, will enable him to relish beauties that are
now rarely perccived in the early course of classical instruction. I
have no doubt but that its appearance will be welcomed by the in-
telligent and discerning‚ as a pubIIcation admirably adapted to en-
list the feelings and stimulate the application of youth, in the
elementary schools of our country.
