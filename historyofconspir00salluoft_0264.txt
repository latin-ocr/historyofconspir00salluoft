Romans into four watches, the beginning of each of which was an·
nouneed by sounding the buccina or horn. This customary announce-
ment was on the present occasion ordered to be omitted: -— omnes si-
mul, ‘⁴ all at once.’' 3. Nullo subveniente, ‘⁴ No one coming to their
assistance :'’ formido quasi vecordia, “terror like a frenzy.”
Formido is a stronger term than timor, and expresses the highest degree
terrore, ‘⁴ from the sright.’'

not menn that it was formed in a square having equal sides; but in
the son-m of a parallelogram οι· quadrilateral reetangular figure, whose
opposite sides are equal, but the length of which is greater than the
breadth. 2. Apud dextimos curabat, “Commanded on the extreme

 

right.” Curabat, in this clause, is absolute or intransitive; so also in the
next: but in the last it is transitive and goverus cohortes. § 38, Obs 5:

Here the subject of futurum (esse) is ea understood which would
regularly require sutura (esse). This is the only instance known in
the classice in which futurum is used in the future infinitivo as ·
indeelinable; but Gellius shows that this was not uncommon in the
early writers. The Bipont edition has futura .· quam uti, dm», “ss
